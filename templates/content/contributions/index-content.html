<h2 id="contribution-guide">Contribution Guide</h2>
<p>The AI Guide will be kickstarted by Mozilla&#39;s team but powered by community contributions. Here&#39;s how you can help! </p>
<h3 id="why-contribute-to-ai-guide">Why contribute to AI Guide?</h3>
<p>Mozilla champions an open, accessible Internet where people have the reins. We welcome these amazing new AI breakthroughs.</p>
<p>However, with substantial corporate dollars being invested into AI R&amp;D, it&#39;s unclear for engineers new to the scene which paths are the ones that lead to sustainable open software. We&#39;ve seen this story before.  </p>
<p>Mozilla&#39;s efforts in AI are more than just technical - they&#39;re a call to action and unity across the currently fragmented open source AI Community. </p>
<p>Our AI Guide is a living, breathing resource, rooted in collaboration and community input for experts and newcomers alike, and we invite you to build alongside us.</p>
