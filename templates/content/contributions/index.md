## Contribution Guide


### Why contribute to AI Guide?
Mozilla champions an open, accessible Internet where people have the reins. We welcome these amazing new AI breakthroughs.

However, with substantial corporate dollars being invested into AI R&D, it's unclear for engineers new to the scene which paths are the ones that lead to sustainable open software. We've seen this story before.  

Mozilla's efforts in AI are more than just technical - they're a call to action and unity across the currently fragmented open source AI Community. 

Our AI Guide is an always-evolving beacon for emerging trends and a hub for experts and newcomers alike to share and grow knowledge, and we ask that you contribute.
